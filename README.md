# Intro

This is a starter project for singleSPA with AngularJS and react. Enjoy!

SingleSPA is an awesome library that allows multiple UI frameworks to co-exist in one web application (Like a UI framework that hosts other UI frameowrks). I find it very useful for ***migration*** from one UI framework to another because it allows you to migrate one page or section at a time.

# How to Run

1. cd SingleSPA_starter_project

2. npm install

3. npm start

# Todo

 - Experiment with webpack.

 - Add unit testing

 - Performance Analysis
